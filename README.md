## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

This project will take a 5 volt source and run a fan based off of temperature change. When the temperature is high, the fan will spin faster and when the temperature is low, the fan will spin slower. On top of this circuit design, there will also be an LCD screen that will read the temperature currently in the room and the current RPM of the fan at the given time. Another reading that will want to be read is the voltage going to the 555 timer as well. 

## Educational Value Added

This project will teach me how to use a 555 timer in a given application, know how to build each part of the circuit to work correctly as intended. Another educational value is being able to convert an analog signal into a digital signal that can be read on an LCD screen. 

## Tasks

1 - Understand how to use a 555 timer and design around the current application 
2 - Build the circuit in LTspice and simulation each part to make sure it works correctly
3 - Build the PCB on Ki-CAD with the correct populations
4 - Build the PCB and test all the parts to make sure that everything is working accordingly 
5 - Code the LCD and get that to display the correct values accordingly

## Timeline

10/19/23 - Today I began the preliminary ideas on building this device. I consolted how to use a 555 timer and will begin to work on a testing design to understand the fuctionality of a 555 timer before moving on the actual circuit design
